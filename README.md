## Project Overview

This project is for developing the official website of Warwick Vocaloid Society (WVS).

The website has two main components:

The first is the **main website**, a (partially dynamic) static site for both members and non-members, providing general information about WVS, event announcements, showcases, contact info, etc.

The second is the **WVS Platform**, a dynamic platform for members only. It includes interactive features like equipment rentals, a jukebox, and showcase submissions.

You can navigate between the two by first registering via the static site (shown on the landing page), which then grants access to the dynamic platform. Once signed in, you can freely move between the two from the navbar.

## Main Features

* Secure user registration and authentication

  * Google Authenticator 2FA supported. After verifying your email, scan the QR code generated on this website with your Google Authenticator app to receive a one-time passcode.
  * You can disable 2FA from your profile page.
* Equipment Rental Service

  * Members can specify the quantity and rental period for items, add them to the cart, and confirm the order to borrow them. Return dates can be checked on the ‚ÄúDashboard‚Äù. You can filter items by search, category, or favorites.
  * Admins can add/edit/delete items in the catalog and edit/cancel orders from the "Rental Log".
* Jukebox

  * Members can submit their favorite songs via YouTube.
  * Admins can play/stop/skip/delete submitted songs from the ‚ÄúSetlist‚Äù during in-person events.
* Showcase

  * Members can submit their works to be showcased.
  * Admins can approve or reject from ‚ÄúShowcase Candidates.‚Äù Approved entries appear in the main website‚Äôs ‚ÄúShowcase‚Äù section. Admins can also edit/delete works from ‚ÄúShowcase Info‚Äù in the WVS Platform.
* Contact Form

  * Members can send inquiries after agreeing to the terms of use.
  * Admins can view, edit, and delete these inquiries as needed.
* User Information

  * Admins can view all member information.
  * Admins can also delete users or edit names, emails, Warwick IDs, and roles.
* Multilingual Support (Japanese and English)

  * Both the main website and WVS Platform allow switching languages from the navbar.
* Dark Mode

  * Users can switch between light and dark mode on the WVS Platform.
* Profile Information

  * All users can manage their personal info, profile picture, and 2FA settings from their profile page.
* Responsive Design

  * All pages are responsive by default.
